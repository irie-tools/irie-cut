# Irie Cut

**The cutting room of the Irie ecosystem.** A free, open, in-browser video editor that
takes the work made upstream — cover art from **Pam**, cinematic clips from **Video
Studio** — and cuts it to the beat: a music-locked promo, captioned and sized for every
platform. Import clips, cut and layer them on a multi-track timeline, grade them, add
titles and captions, score the cut, and export an MP4 — no account, no watermark, nothing
uploaded. Your media lives in the browser (IndexedDB) and every frame is rendered
on-device.

It belongs to the **Irie ecosystem** but carries its own music-forward voice: a warm
near-black canvas, the Irie **red / gold / green** energy palette (a single **Irie-green
`#25c281`** accent flowing through the app, off the old forked cyan), **Bebas Neue** marquee
display + **Space Grotesk** body, and a landing hero that's *alive* — equalizer, sweeping
playhead, beat-popping segments — ready to swap for a real screen-recording of the editor.
See `ECOSYSTEM-RESKIN-SPEC.md`.

Irie Cut began as a rebuild on top of the [OpenCut](https://github.com/opencut-app/opencut)
rewrite scaffold (MIT) and is developed independently. Where producer features were
inspired by an earlier media-studio prototype, they were re-implemented here as real,
working features (the prototype's were largely placeholders).

## Features

**Editing**
- Multi-track timeline — video, image, audio and text tracks; drag-to-move with **snapping**, edge-trim, split at the playhead, duplicate, **ripple delete**, markers, zoom-to-fit.
- Track headers — rename, mute, solo, lock, per-track volume, reorder, delete.
- Per-clip **transform** (scale, opacity, rotation, x/y), **speed** (0.25–4×), and color-grade **filters**.
- **Transitions** — fade, slide (4 dirs), zoom in/out, wipe — per-clip in/out, composited into preview *and* export.
- **Undo/redo** with gesture coalescing (a drag or slider sweep is one step).
- Timeline polish — video **filmstrip thumbnails** and decoded **audio waveforms** on clips.

**Preview & export**
- Canvas preview with real-time playback, synced audio, master volume.
- **Audio mixing** — clip × track × master gain, mute/solo, fade envelopes — identical in preview and export.
- **In-browser MP4 export** (H.264 + AAC) via canvas `captureStream` + Web Audio + `MediaRecorder`.

**Producer / studio**
- Format templates (UGC Reel, Square, Widescreen, Vertical Quote) that set the canvas and drop a starter layout.
- **Captions** → valid `.srt` / `.vtt` export from text-clip timing.
- **Story beats** (hook/problem/proof/product/human/benefit/CTA) → structured **EDL** and **cutdown** JSON export.
- **Creative scorecard** — a real 0–100 score (hook, CTA, length, caption coverage, audio, pacing, aspect) with inline fixes.

**AI assist** (optional, see below)
- Marketing copy (hooks/CTAs/captions/scripts), image generation, and auto-captions.

**Private by default** — projects and media persist in IndexedDB; the only network calls are the optional AI endpoints.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| UI | React 19, TanStack Router (file-based), Tailwind v4, base-ui / shadcn components, lucide icons |
| State | zustand (single editor store with undo/redo) |
| Persistence | IndexedDB (projects, media metadata, media blobs) |
| Rendering | HTML Canvas 2D compositor (shared by preview + export) |
| Audio | Web Audio API (mixing graph in export; element gain in preview) |
| Build | Vite 8 → static SPA |
| Serverless | Vercel Functions in `/api` (dependency-free) for AI |
| Hosting | Vercel (static SPA + `/api` functions), git-auto-deploy |

There is no backend for the editor itself — it is a pure client-side SPA. The only
server code is the optional AI functions in `/api`.

## Development

Uses [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) to pin `bun` + `moon` (versions in `.prototools`):

```sh
proto use            # installs bun + moon
cd apps/web
bun install
bun run dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

Build the static site:

```sh
cd apps/web
bun run build        # outputs apps/web/dist
```

> AI endpoints (`/api/*`) don't run under plain `vite dev`. Use `vercel dev` from the
> repo root, or test them on the deployed site.

## AI assist (optional)

The editor is fully functional without AI. To enable it, set keys in your Vercel
project env. Each feature uses the provider it's best at, and each falls back gracefully.

| Feature | Provider order | Key(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Copy assist | Anthropic (Claude) → AI Gateway → OpenAI | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` *(and/or)* `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Image generation | OpenAI `gpt-image-1` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Auto-captions | OpenAI Whisper | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |

Copy assist prefers a direct `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (native Messages API, Claude Sonnet 4.6),
because the Vercel AI Gateway free tier gates premium models. With only a gateway key it
uses the gateway; with only an OpenAI key it uses GPT. Set any one and it works.

**Optional overrides:**

```text
AI_ANTHROPIC_MODEL      default claude-sonnet-4-6      (native Anthropic id, hyphens)
AI_TEXT_MODEL           default anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6   (gateway slug, dots)
AI_OPENAI_TEXT_MODEL    default gpt-4o-mini
AI_BASE_URL             default https://ai-gateway.vercel.sh/v1
AI_IMAGE_MODEL          default gpt-image-1
AI_IMAGE_BASE_URL       default https://api.openai.com/v1
AI_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL     default whisper-1
AI_TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL  default https://api.openai.com/v1
```

Env changes apply to **new** deployments — redeploy after setting keys.

## Deployment

The web app is a static SPA built from `apps/web`. The **root `vercel.json`** wires:
- `installCommand` / `buildCommand` that build `apps/web`
- `outputDirectory` → `apps/web/dist`
- a SPA rewrite that sends client routes to `index.html` **but excludes `/api`**
- `/api/*` serverless functions (auto-detected at the repo root)

The GitHub repo is connected to the Vercel project, so **pushing to `main` auto-deploys**.
(`apps/web/vercel.json` exists for one-off `cd apps/web && vercel --prod` CLI deploys.)
